To replace the images with your own, 
add your profile picture and your banner picture in this folder (img). 
Rename your images as shown in the example. 

Profile picture: mypicture
Banner image: MyBannerPicture
Make sure your images are in .jpg format

(If you are more comfortable with HTML and CSS, 
you can change the name of the images directly in the 
index.html and Style.css files)
